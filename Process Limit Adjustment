### Task Description

In the Stratos Datacenter, our Storage server is encountering performance degradation due to excessive processes held by the `nfsuser` user. To mitigate this issue, we need to enforce limitations on its maximum processes. The requirements are as follows:

- **Soft limit:** 1024
- **Hard limit:** 2024

We need to add these limits to the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file.

### Steps to Implement the Solution

1. **Open the Limits Configuration File**  
   Access the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file using a text editor with administrative privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf
   ```

2. **Set the Soft and Hard Limits**  
   Scroll to the end of the file and add the following lines to define the process limits for the `nfsuser`:

   ```
   nfsuser soft nproc 1024  # Set the soft limit to 1024 processes.
   nfsuser hard nproc 2024  # Set the hard limit to 2024 processes.
   ```

3. **Save and Exit**  
   After making the changes, save the file and exit the editor:
   - For Nano: Press `CTRL + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.
   - For Vim: Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and press `Enter` to save and exit.

4. **Verification**  
   To ensure the limits are applied correctly, you can check the current limit for the `nfsuser` by running:

   ```bash
   ulimit -u 1500  # Verifies that the current process limit is applied correctly.
   ```

This process helps in controlling the system's performance by capping the number of processes the `nfsuser` can create. ðŸ˜Š
