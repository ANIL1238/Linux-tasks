### 📌 **Nautilus Backup Server Configuration Requirements**

The Nautilus System Admins team has recently rolled out a web UI application for their backup utility. This application operates on port **5003** and is running on the Nautilus backup server within the Stratos Datacenter. To ensure smooth operation, the following tasks need to be performed:

---

### 🔥 **1. Ensure Firewalld is Active**

- **Task**: Confirm that `firewalld` is running on the server.
- **Command**:

ssh clint@172.16.238.16

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status firewalld
  ```
  - If not active, start and enable it with:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start firewalld
    sudo systemctl enable firewalld
    ```

---

### 🌐 **2. Open Port 5003**

- **Task**: Allow incoming traffic on port **5003** to ensure the web UI application is accessible.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5003/tcp --permanent
  ```
  - **Note**: `--permanent` ensures the rule persists across reboots.

---

### 💾 **3. Reload Firewall Configuration**

- **Task**: Apply the firewall changes to activate the new rule.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

---

### ✅ **4. Verify the Port is Open**

- **Task**: Confirm that port **5003** is now open and accessible.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --query-port=5003/tcp
  ```
  - **Expected Output**: `yes`

---

### 📋 **Summary**

By following these steps, the Nautilus backup server's web UI application will be properly accessible on port **5003** while ensuring that the firewall settings are correctly configured and persistent.
